# FindyourDoc

FindyourDoc is a doctor listing and search interface built for the Campus Assessment by **Bajaj Finserv Health**. The goal was to create a clean and functional page to help users find doctors based on filters, search, and sort options â€” all done on the frontend.

## How I made it

- **Framework**: Built with [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/), using the App Router.
- **Styling**: Done with TailwindCSS for a simple and clean layout.
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Data Handling**:
  - Doctor data is fetched from the provided API once on load.
  - All filters, sorting, and search features run fully on the client side.
- **State Management**: Search and filters are synced with the URL using query parameters so the page remembers your selection even if you refresh or use the browser's back button.
- **Testing Ready**: Added all the `data-testid` attributes required for automation testing.

## What I'd like to add next

This was a focused version of the platform for the assessment, but I'd love to keep building on it and eventually develop a full-featured site. Some things I have in mind for the future:

- A detailed doctor profile page with availability, reviews, and booking options
- Responsive design for mobile and tablets
- Option to favorite or bookmark doctors
- Animations and subtle transitions to make the UI feel smoother
- Possibly adding authentication and a simple dashboard for users
